    " Premise 1: All nanostructured drug delivery systems with zeta potentials between -15mV and -30mV exhibit enhanced permeability across the blood-brain barrier when particle size is under 100nm.\nPremise 2: The experimental Alzheimer's treatment compound ALZ-290B, when encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles using modified nanoprecipitation, consistently produces particles with sizes between 70-85nm and zeta potentials averaging -22mV.\nInference: Therefore, ALZ-290B when delivered via these PLGA nanoparticles will exhibit enhanced permeability across the blood-brain barrier.\n\nThis inference follows directly from the premises without introducing any new elements. The conclusion is a straightforward application of the general principle in Premise 1 to the specific case described in Premise 2.",
    " When analyzing compiler optimization effects on cryptographic implementations, we can observe that GCC's loop unrolling optimization (specifically -funroll-loops at optimization levels O2 and O3) creates a measurable side-channel vulnerability in AES implementations using T-table lookups. When comparing compiled binaries of identical source code with and without this flag, power analysis traces show that the unrolled version leaks approximately 3.8x more key information through cache timing variations during the first two rounds of encryption. This occurs because the unrolled loop creates additional memory access patterns that are directly correlated with key bytes, whereas the rolled version's access patterns are partially obscured by loop control operations. Therefore, we can logically infer that cryptographic library developers who enable aggressive compiler optimizations without specifically excluding loop unrolling are inadvertently reducing the practical security of their implementations, even when the mathematical algorithm remains uncompromised.",
    " Premise 1: All patients with homozygous Factor V Leiden mutation have a hypercoagulable state.\nPremise 2: Patient X has been diagnosed with homozygous Factor V Leiden mutation.\nInference: Therefore, Patient X has a hypercoagulable state."
