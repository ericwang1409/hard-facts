Starting with prompt: 'can you generate an inference or fact that is hard to find online? Inferences or facts that require fairly specific expertise to explain that is costly to obtain (e.g. something only a cardiologist would say).
Facts that require combinations of multiple costly areas of expertise to be aware of. For example the agent could: 
Pick two situationally meaningful topics, like “vulnerability detection” and “the PRC civilian monitoring apparatus” (making the topic situationally meaningful makes these examples harder for humans to construct)
Then explain a connection between the two topics that would require extensive expertise in both for a human to explain.
Facts that relate to the semantics of an obscure document that would not turn up in keyword searches. For example, an agent could:
Pick a situationally meaningful topic, e.g. “vulnerability detection”
Then identify a document that is related to the topic, but which is mostly only semantically related. For example, maybe there exists a physics paper which, for whatever reason, relies heavily on computer security concepts.
Name this document.

i will grade you on how easily i can find this fact on google, and whether or not the inference is reasonable or fact is true. try to do as well as you can. Start the fact with '$##' or else you will be penalized. Also, keep the fact to two sentences or less.'
