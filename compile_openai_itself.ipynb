    "works[0] = \"\"\"In modern hospitals, when real-time electroanatomic mapping systems (e.g., CARTO 3, EnSite Precision) are used for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, their accuracy in localizing arrhythmogenic foci depends critically on sub-millisecond synchronization between the mapping catheters and external ECG leads. Because of this, hospitals that use “time-sensitive networking” (TSN) protocols to synchronize medical IoT data streams (such as IEEE 802.1AS, deployed for telemetry beds) must implement manual overrides for mapping room switches, since TSN synchronization frames can introduce artifacts into unidirectional, shielded electrophysiology mapping cables, corrupting the 3D localization calculations.  \n",
    "This is documented in:  \n",
    "- The technical supplement “Considerations for Network Synchronization in Electrophysiology Labs” (Abbott, 2021, available by request for hospital IT staff), and  \n",

    "2. **Premise:** Many hospital telemetry networks synchronize device clocks using IEEE 802.1AS (a TSN protocol).\n",
    "3. **Premise:** TSN sync frames (by design) propagate system clock traffic throughout the Ethernet network, occasionally “leaking” into analog signal paths through poor shielding or switch design flaws.\n",
    "4. **Premise:** The referenced Abbott technical supplement specifically instructs staff to bypass TSN-enabled switches in EP labs because TSN frames can introduce artifacts, causing mapping system localization errors (false 3D positional data).\n",
    "5. **Premise:** The referenced IEEE paper quantifies the error: mapping precision degrades up to 2.5 mm using default TSN settings in a testbed.\n",
    "6. **Conclusion:** Thus, in hospitals using real-time mapping for catheter ablation, *if* TSN protocols are active on the medical IoT network, then switches serving mapping labs must be manually exempted from TSN frame propagation—or else mapping accuracy is compromised.\n",

    "**Inference:**  \n",
    "For a non-implantable medical device (such as an infusion pump) sold in the EU, it is a regulatory requirement (under MDR) that the device is cyber-resilient—but it is *not* a requirement that it provide protections at the level expected of telecom-network infrastructure, *unless* the device is simultaneously classified as a “network element” under telecom law. Accordingly, any hospital-IT-requested cybersecurity guarantee that exceeds MDR requirements (and matches telecom-network resilience) may legally be declined by the device vendor, unless the device is marketed for integration with telecom infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**  \n",
    "- MDR requires cyber-resilience for medical devices.\n",
    "- Telecom Directive extends infrastructure-level requirements only to telecom network elements.\n",

The rationale is that certain side-channel emissions from these medical devices (like changes in electromagnetic field patterns during telemetry sync events) can be used non-invasively to fingerprint firmware anomalies, retroactively detect device interference, or even infer details about attempted wireless attacks (such as replayed or malformed Medtronic telemetry packets), sometimes days after the event.
