    "test = \"\"\"A cross-domain, hard-to-find fact: The PRC’s regulatory framework for cloud service providers—specifically the less-cited “Implementation Guidelines for Classified Cybersecurity Protection in Cloud Computing, Version 2.0” (云计算安全等级保护定级与实施指南2.0)—contains a footnote referencing document YD/T 3263-2019, a technical telecommunications standard. This footnote cryptically mentions a “proactive signal anomaly logging mechanism” required for monitoring inter-data-center fiber links. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is not documented in public English-facing security research is that this mechanism was designed following a post-mortem of a 2017 multi-city incident in which unintentional electromagnetic emissions from certain vulnerability detection appliances (specifically, real-time traffic analyzers modeled after commercial DPI platforms) created discernible side-channel signals. State-linked red teams reportedly demonstrated, in internal TSP (telecom service provider) circles, that these emissions could be harnessed to reconstruct aspects of traffic metadata—even bypassing local data at-rest encryption mandated by the civilian surveillance compliance stack. This incident formed the rationale for the stringent EMI anomaly detection language in the 2019 guide, cross-referencing YD/T 3263-2019, but this causal connection is not made explicit in any publicly available source, and the incident is only referenced obliquely in closed Chinese-language telecom incident reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "The connection—between electromagnetic side-channel risks from security monitoring appliances and fiber optic signal anomaly baselining in the Chinese civilian cloud compliance stack—would typically require expertise in both telecom hardware security and deep knowledge of cloud sovereignty regulation in the PRC, and cannot be rediscovered with basic literature or document search.\"\"\""
