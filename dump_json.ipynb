    "test = \"\"\"Logical inference: In the field of vulnerability detection for embedded medical devices, one can deduce that research into countering side-channel attacks is directly relevant to privacy risks in personalized genomic surveillance systems deployed by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for targeted population monitoring (e.g., in Xinjiang province). This is because the PRC’s “Mass DNA Collection” protocols, described in the “China’s Mass DNA Collection” Human Rights Watch report (2017), necessarily rely on field-deployed biometric collection devices that (according to procurement contracts documented in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure archives, CNKI: “新疆区域生物采集终端安全设计”, 2016) employ embedded cryptographic chips similar to those known to be vulnerable to power analysis and electromagnetic side-channel attacks as shown in the medical device literature (see “On-chip Protection for EM Side-Channel Attacks in Implantable Medical Devices,” IEEE TBCAS, 2015). Therefore, this combination of medical device security research and PRC-specific surveillance procurement shows that adversaries with side-channel expertise could theoretically extract private population data from field-deployed devices—an inference that is not explicitly stated in surveillance or medical literature, and requires specialized knowledge across both domains.\"\"\""
